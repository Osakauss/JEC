# todo

- Add assertion methods !!!

we want to make sure functions get passed correct values

# error module

just like the symtab module, create another `error` module,
that can provide functionality to functions by being passed
around as an injected dependency

- abort program from anywhere (assertions)
- propagate error information (no return values for errors)
